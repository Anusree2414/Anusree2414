# About me

Hi, Anusree here
Data Analyst | Power BI | Python | SQL | Excel | Data Storytelling  

I am a Software Engineer turned Data Analyst with a strong analytical mindset and a passion for uncovering insights from data.
My experience working in technical problem-solving roles has shaped the way I approach data — with precision, curiosity, and a focus on meaningful outcomes.

Transitioning into analytics allowed me to connect my love for logic with real-world business problems. Through hands-on projects and a Data Analytics certification, 
I have gained practical experience in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and dashboard building using Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel.

I enjoy transforming raw datasets into clear stories that help stakeholders make better decisions, identify patterns, and improve processes. 
My growing portfolio captures some of my best work — each project includes a brief overview along with the tools and techniques used.
