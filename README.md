# About me

Hi, Anusree here
Data Analyst | Power BI | Python | SQL | Excel | Data Storytelling  

I am a Software Engineer turned Data Analyst with a strong analytical mindset and a passion for uncovering insights from data.
My experience working in technical problem-solving roles has shaped the way I approach data — with precision, curiosity, and a focus on meaningful outcomes.

Transitioning into analytics allowed me to connect my love for logic with real-world business problems. Through hands-on projects and a Data Analytics certification, 
I have gained practical experience in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and dashboard building using Power BI, SQL, Python, and Excel.

I enjoy transforming raw datasets into clear stories that help stakeholders make better decisions, identify patterns, and improve processes. 
My growing portfolio captures some of my best work — each project includes a brief overview along with the tools and techniques used.

Below is a curated portfolio of my best work — each project includes a description, and tools used.

🔹 Power BI Sales Dashboard

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance across cities and restaurants. Built a complete data model with DAX measures and KPIs (Revenue, Orders, AOV, Discounts). 
Identified top-performing regions, peak sales months, discount usage patterns, delivery time trends, and customer behavior insights. Helped visualize ₹40.52M revenue and 86,894 orders to support 
strategic decision-making.
Tools: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling Techniques: KPI design, trend analysis, performance ranking 
Outcome: Identified top cities/restaurants, peak months, discount efficiency, and customer engagement insights

🔹 Netflix Movies & TV Shows Data Analysis (Python)

Cleaned and processed a 7.8k-record Netflix dataset using Pandas, handling missing values, inconsistent data, and text fields. Engineered new features such as movie duration and TV season counts. 
Performed EDA using grouping, aggregations, and visualizations in Matplotlib to identify content trends across years, genres, and countries. Produced high-quality charts suitable for reporting and analytics.
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy) Techniques: Data cleaning, missing-value imputation, merging, automation 
 Outcome: Produced analysis-ready consolidated datasets with accurate workflows.

 🔹 Employee & Project Data Analysis (Python – Pandas)

Cleaned, merged, and transformed multiple employee, seniority, and project datasets. Automated business logic to handle bonus calculations, designation changes, and missing cost values using running averages. 
Delivered a final consolidated dataset with accurate employee-wise project cost summaries, demonstrating strong workflow automation and data manipulation skills.
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy) Techniques: Data cleaning, missing-value imputation, merging, automation 
Outcome: Produced analysis-ready consolidated datasets with accurate workflows.

🔹 Funnel Analysis & Reporting (Excel)

Conducted weekly performance analysis to understand order fluctuations and conversion issues across funnel stages (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O). Compared daily traffic and orders against previous week trends, 
focusing on changes beyond ±20%. Identified root causes such as traffic drops, discount variations, delivery charges, and out-of-stock issues. Delivered clear insights explaining high/low performance and 
drivers behind funnel changes.
Tools: Excel, Funnel Metrics, Trend Analysis Techniques: L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O analysis, Root-cause insights 
Outcome: Delivered concise insights linking each fluctuation to its root cause.
